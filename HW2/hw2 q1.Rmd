1. Assume that spot rates are as follows:

|Maturity|Spot Rate|
|:------:|:-------:|
|1       |5%       |
|2       |5.5%     |
|3       |6%       |
|4       |6.3%     |

Spot rates are with annual compounding, coupon payments are annual, and par values
are $100. Compute the prices of the following bonds:

(a) A zero-coupon bond with 3 years to maturity.

$$
\frac{100}{(1+0.06)^3} = 83.96
$$

**The price of such a zero-coupon bond is 83.96.**

$$
\frac{100}{(1+\text{ytm})^3} = 83.96\\
$$
**Solve and we get ytm = 0.06**

(b) A bond with coupon rate 6% and 2 years to maturity.

$$
\frac{6}{(1+0.05)} + \frac{106}{(1+0.055)^2} = 100.95
$$

**The price of such a coupon bond is 100.95.**

$$
\frac{6}{(1+\text{ytm})} + \frac{106}{(1+\text{ytm})^2} = 100.95 \\
$$
**Solve and we get ytm = 0.0548.**

(c) A bond with coupon rate 8% and 4 years to maturity.

$$
\frac{8}{(1+0.05)} + \frac{8}{(1+0.05)^2} + \frac{8}{(1+0.05)^3} + \frac{108}{(1+0.05)^4} = 106.11
$$

**The price of such coupon bond is 106.11.**

$$
\frac{8}{(1+\text{ytm})} + \frac{8}{(1+\text{ytm})^2} + \frac{8}{(1+\text{ytm})^3} + \frac{108}{(1+\text{ytm})^4} = 106.11
$$
**Solve and we get ytm = 0.0623**
