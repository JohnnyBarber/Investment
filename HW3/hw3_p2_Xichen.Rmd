# Problem 2

(a) The relevant forward rate: ${}_{1}f_{2}$, which is between year 1 and 3.
$\\$
(b) The forward rate:$\\$
$$(1+{}_{1}f_{2})^2=\frac{(1+r_3)^3}{1+r_1}\\$$
$${}_{1}f_{2}=0.08=8\%\\$$
The relevant forward rate is 8%.$\\$
$\\$
(c) The strategy to lock in the future rate:$\\$
In year 0:$\\$
Short one-year zero-coupon bonds for $\frac{1 \text{M}}{1+r_1}$ dollars, and then use the money receivd from the sell to long three-year zero-coupon bonds for $\frac{1 \text{M}}{1+r_1}$ dollars. $\\$
No net initial investment because the cash inflow equals cash outflow, which is $\frac{1 \text{M}}{1+r_1}$. $\\$
In year 1:$\\$
There will be a cash outflow of 1\text{M} dollars.$\\$
At year 3:$\\$ 
There will be a cash inflow of $\frac{1 \text{M}\times(1+r_3)^3}{1+r_1}$ dollars.$\\$
This implies the rate ${}_{1}f_{2}$ between years 1 and 3.
